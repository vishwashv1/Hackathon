I Designed the Menu at start.

I created the namespace SampleFramework and Created UI layer. create Medicals inside  Class inside it, which
holds the string type values which the user inputs.



In my second Namespace Database, I created Class DiseaseDatabase in which I have written the function of AddingDisease, Symptoms, and patient details.

My 3rd Namespace is UI, UI class.
This consists Menu Design, Repo, main Test for Console, and have written function to take inputs from the user.

And  last Namespace MedicalConsole, I have done a class Medical, in which the main Function Medical() starts the whole process.

I have written Utilities in other class file, defined GetNumber and string in Utilities.
